# BACKEND CHALLENGS

1. Data collection was a major chhalenge in this project
    because it required collecting data from multiple sources.
    The data was collected from the following sources: 
        FNB website
        ABSA website

2. Because the Bank websites didn't have an API that provide us with the bank packages information,
    I thought of web scraping and another challenge arose which is that the bank didn't share the 
    package information on the website but they provide the information on a PDF.
3. I create a PDF scraper to scrape the information from the PDF file.
4. Another challenge I faced was that the PDF file was not in a standard format.
    It was not consistent through out all the banks

5. After the Data collection needed to put it in a database and it was a challenge
    because the data was not in a standard format and it was not easy to put it in a database.
    And know how to sctructure the tables and columns was a challenge .

6. The interection between the database and the API was a challenge because of how the information
    was stored.
    There was multiple tables and I had to join them together to get the information I needed.
